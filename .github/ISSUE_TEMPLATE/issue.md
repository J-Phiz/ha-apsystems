<!--
If your question concerns Home Assistant, the HA-APSystems add-on, or configuration, you've come to the right place!

However, if your question concerns creating an application id/secret for APSystems OpenAPI, this is an issue with APSystems, so I encourage you to contact them directly.

Note: To facilitate analysis of your issues, please include as much detail as possible, such as your logs, configuration, or screenshots. Thank you!
